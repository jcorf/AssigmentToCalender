# AssigmentToCalender
Objective: Importing an assignment spreadsheet into google calenders and ask a task list

Google's Task API does not have the ability to specifically set the time of a task so the purpose of the task list is to provide an adjacent list to the calenders. I would prefer a Task List that corresponds time-wise but it is simply not possible, so the events are created. However, the event colors change when completed (Red = Incomplete, Green = Complete). Another option would be to manually move the task list but this is very tedious. 

Directions: 

Copy of Blank Spreadsheet -- 

Calender.gs -- run runScript in the Extensions > App Script
Tasks.gs -- run ...
